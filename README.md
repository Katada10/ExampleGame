# ExampleGame
A simple, small game I made in a few days to display some Unity Scripting skills.
To view code, go into Assets/Scripts. The assets folder also contains all the objects and materials used
in the game. The Unity Scenes can be downloaded and opened from Assets/Scenes.

To run the game, download the repo, extract it and navigate to executable, you can delete the Assets folder if you want.
In the executable, run the Sample Project.exe to start the game.

Controls:
A/D OR Left/Right Arrow: Move Left/Right
Spacebar: Jump
